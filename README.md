# Learning from jQuery

This is the code repository that goes with [Learning from jQuery](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026280.do), containing all major functions and code samples from the book.

## Files in this repo

- `ajax.js` contains the `request()` function and `get()` and `post()` aliases from Chapter 4: AJAX.
- `events.js` contains the `addEventListener()`, `triggerEvent()` and `removeEventListener()` functions.
- The `ajax` directory contains the simple PHP AJAX example from Chapter 4: AJAX. It relies on both `ajax.js` and `events.js`.
- The `docblockExample` directory contains example files with docblocks in, from Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions. There is only one example so far, feel free to add your own and send a pull request.
